# AlarmClock
For those days that you fear that your standard alarm clock might not be enough

# Usage
In the file "AlarmClock.py", set the variable "setTime" to whatever day you'd like the alarm to go off.
Use one of the preset site url variables, or make your own. It is set up so that when the current time is equal to the setTime, the site variable will open a webbrowser to that site (youtube) and automatically begin playing the video.
