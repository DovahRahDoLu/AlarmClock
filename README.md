For those days that you fear that your standard alarm clock might not be enough

# Usage
-Run AlarmClock.py <br />
-It will prompt user to input day value. the day the alarm is supposed to be set to is the first day of a new month, then add a day to the last day of the current month. This is because month implementation has not been implemented yet. <br />
-It will then prompt the hour to input. must be 24 hour time based.
-Minute and second inputs are standard.

## Configuration
Use one of the preset site url variables, or make your own. It is set up so that when the current time is equal to the setTime, the site variable will open a webbrowser to that site (youtube) and automatically begin playing the video.
